📌 README: Student Database Management System
📖 Introduction
The Student Database Management System is a C++ program that allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete student records using an unordered_map for efficient data management.

This program provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations on student records, including inserting students, searching by ID, updating grades, and displaying all students.

⚡ Features
✅ Insert Student → Add student ID & grade to the database.
✅ Delete Student → Remove a student from the database using their ID.
✅ Search Student → Find a student by their ID and display their grade.
✅ Update Grade → Modify the grade of an existing student.
✅ Display All Students → Show all students in the database.
✅ Display Size → Show the total number of students in the database.
✅ Clear Database → Remove all student records.
✅ Exit → Close the program.
